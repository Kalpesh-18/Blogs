# Mobile Data

## Overview
We simply switch on the mobile data on our smartphones to connect to the internet, but have you ever thought who provides this data, how the limit is determined, and, most importantly, how everything stops or slows down after your data pack is consumed?

As we all know, the internet is a "network of networks" that can be accessed in two ways, both of which use radio waves for data transmission.

1. **Cellular Data:** You can access internet via Cellular Data as long as youâ€™re in a geographical area covered by your mobile network carrier or network towers.

2. **WiFi:** You can access internet via WiFi as long as you're in close proximity with the WiFi router or any other connection device.

## How does your phone connect to cell tower

In order to access to the internet, a Sim card is one thing that is absolutely necessary. This chip functions as an entryway to calls, messages, and the Internet in the palm of your hand.

**Subscriber Identity Module** is referred to as SIM. When you buy a SIM card, a number of unique special numbers that uniquely identify you in the network operator's database are stored on it. By using these codes, you can access the internet.

**International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)**, is a 64-bit number that is included on the SIM card and is unique to each subscriber. A special authentication key is also included on the SIM card.

However, have you ever experienced a tiny delay in the process of activating your SIM card? This is because the network tower is currently verifying your identity to determine whether you are a registered user or not. 

Additionally, you must have noticed a list of mobile networks if you attempted to select one manually. If you attempted to connect to a different network, it would take a few seconds and display an error. Let's see what happens behind all of this.

Once this connection is made, data travels over in bits of 1s and 0s while your data usage is monitored and counted. Therefore, depending on your Internet Service Provider, as soon as you hit the data limit, either your bandwidth is decreased, which will result in slower speed, or the connection is dropped.
