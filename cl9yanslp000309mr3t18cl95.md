# What is Cloud Computing?

## Overview

To put it simply, a cloud is a collection of physical servers that exist in one area and are accessible over the internet. The primary goal of cloud technology is to eliminate dependency on physical hardware. For example, you may be unaware that the blog you are currently reading is being served by a server located in a cloud network.

## Why use Cloud?
To understand more about cloud foundations, consider the following example.
Assume you're intending to launch an e-commerce website (Amazhon), and your website code is ready and tested locally on your laptop or PC.
Consider the following inquiries:


- Because there are already well-established e-commerce websites, you want to start small and gradually develop while budgeting your spending.

- You don't want to buy servers since they raise your Capex (capital expenditure), and you'd have to spend money on maintaining them; alternatively, you may rent servers that are managed by another authority.

- You're concerned about security while renting servers; you don't want the authority in charge of maintaining the server to look into your database.

- You have a large increase in orders during the Diwali season, and your present servers collapse owing to the large amount of queries. As a result, you merely need additional servers only during the Diwali season.

- Because your client base is more concentrated in Asia than in Europe, you prefer servers located near Asia to minimize service response time (although somewhat).

These are just a handful of the issues that cloud technology can tackle. The next section will explain how these difficulties are addressed.
## Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. **On demand self-service** - It is based on a self-service architecture, which allows clients to manage services like as storage, databases, and server uptime. It enables you to monitor server utilization. Cloud service providers do not teach their customers how to use their services; instead, they charge them at the end of the billing cycle based on their usage.

2. **Broad network access** - Because you are accessing your server over the internet, you are not need to be physically present where the server is situated. You can access or make changes to your files from anywhere in the globe; all you need is a strong internet connection and a device.

3. **Resource pooling** - Just like you many other people might want to use Cloud Technology, hence computing resources (such as networks, servers, and storage) are shared by several tenants while maintaining security. This can be accomplished by introducing a multiple-tenant arrangement, similar to a large apartment where each individual has his or her own flat but shares the apartment. A cloud service provider can share resources among clients, allowing each client to receive services tailored to their specific needs. This is done to maximize resource use and depends on deployment model used in cloud.
  - **Private Cloud**: Cloud configuration for a single organization, great privacy and performance since data and resources are not shared by other companies.
  - **Public Cloud**: Cloud accessible publicly, as multiple people from different organizations use the cloud with different intentions, security and performance is low.
  - **Community Cloud**: Cloud setup for a community of people (can be from same or different organization) using the resources for one particular motive. Generally lands somewhere in between Private and Public Cloud in terms of performance and security.
  - **Hybrid Cloud**: A combination of private, public cloud to achieve the best of both


4. **Measured services** - In the cloud, the 'pay as you go' approach is applied, which means that you only pay for the services that you use. As a result, cloud computing is becoming more economical.
  
5. **Elasticity** - In cloud computing, compute nodes (servers) can be added and removed with relative ease. As a result, you can easily scale in and scale out depending on your needs. There are two kinds of scaling.
  - **Vertical scaling** - Increasing the computational power of your server.
  - **Horizontal scaling** - Adding new servers of the same computational power.

Now that we've established what cloud computing is, let's look at how cloud service providers supply these services.

## Cloud Service Models

Cloud service companies provide their services using one of three popular models:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: IaaS is providing infrastructure services to consumers such as physical computing resources, scaling, security, storage, and networking. 
Eg - Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: PaaS is providing a development environment (typically like operating system, database, Integrated Development Environment, etc.). 
Eg - Google App Engine, Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Users can access applications and software from anywhere in the world using the Software as a Service (SaaS) concept. Eg - Google Drive, Netflix, Google Docs.
- **Function as a Service (FaaS)**: FaaS, often known as serverless computing, divides cloud applications into smaller components that execute only when needed. FaaS or serverless applications, like all cloud computing architectures, continue to run on servers. They are nicknamed "serverless" because they do not run on dedicated machines and so do not require management. Furthermore, because functions are lower in size than applications, they may be scaled up and down fast.
